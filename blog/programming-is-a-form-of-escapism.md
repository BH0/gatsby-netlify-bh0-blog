title: Programming Is A Form Of Escapism
---
Programming is an amazing form of expression, and many believe it is as much an art than it is a science. But, I consider programming to be my ultimate form of escapism, I am not going to explain why it is my form of escapism (as it is a personal subject) in this post, but I will explain to you why it has been an excellent form of escapism for many people. 

Theoretically (depending on your skill level / knowledge), you could code your way out of a room full of deadly laser cannons, but this blog post is about the more "emotional" type of escapism. 

# Being In The Zone 
Being in the zone is to be focusing on something so incredibly well that you forget about the world around you. If you have built something you are proud of, chances are high that you have been in the zone. I love being in the zone - it's like a super productive daydream. 

# Computer Just Do 
To be honest, this is ideal and is not always the case, but for the most part, it can feel good to be telling the computer what to do and how to do something and the computer just does it, it doesn't go "ok, well... I will do it in a couple of hours", or "I felt like doing that yesterday but not today". And if you ever wanna code like those "coders" in the movies and television shows [for whatever reason], but do not feel like coding at the specific point in time then perhaps this video will help you out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rO8-cgtkZSw . 

# I Am Doing Good For Myself and Others 
One of my main reasons for loving programming and developing software is the belief that I am helping myself and/or others. I love building something that will improve at least one person's life. And considering that many people can use the same software, the result is easily multiplied - as well as the feeling. 

# Literally Build Your Fantasy 
I love game development, particularly because it gave me the chance to build my own worlds that I might want to live in, for example, you could build a world swarmed with pet dragons. Or a world where everyone shares your opinion. Many programmers are incredibly creative people.
