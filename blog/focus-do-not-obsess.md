title: Focus Do Not Obsess
---
Over the past few weeks I have been focusing on improving a particular skill, whereas now I believe I have become obsessed with seeing results and evidence of improvement. And I believe the obsession is holding me back. 

I am potentially working too hard to improve this skill. I am doing it so often that my brain is not getting enough time to recharge, so when I start off doing the skill I improve a tiny bit, then i say to myselfâ€¦ let's do more and before i know it I just feel negative, and I am surprised I am not yet burned out. 

I would like to encourage you to ensure that you are looking at something with fresh eyes, and that you are not overdoing something that may or may not be working. 

Remember to take breaks, and to improve a skill requires commitment and consistency, but you have to be delineate, break the skill in to parts and focus on those parts, don't just mindlessly try to improve. Prioritise and use your time wisely. 

This sort of aligns with what many talented people supposedly do. Try different things, you can't trust a process that you do not understand. Listen to criticism but try not to be held back due to it. 

Focus on improving but do not become obsessed with improving. Thanks for reading.
