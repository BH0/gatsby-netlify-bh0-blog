Why You Should Complete Programming Exercises 

Programming exercises are worth doing, and this blog post will tell you why. By programming exercises I am referring to stuff such as “reverse a string”, and fizzbuzz. They are often used in job interviews. 

# Discovery 
Programming exercises are a great way to discover functions and features of the language that you might not bother to look at when doing projects, but might help in future projects. 

# Refresher 
I like to do programming exercises to refresh my knowledge of a language, as many of them are language agnostic.  And they require little time commitment, as well as proving to be a good brain warm up. 

# They build problem solving ability 
Programming is all about solving problems, programming exercises are problems that you can solve. The more you do, the better you get. 

# Examples 
There are loads of programing exercises, various data structures and algorithms  on websites such as Project Euler, Hackerrank and of course Youtube. The Youtube channel Traversy Media offers a “JavaScript Cardio” playlist. V. Anton Spraul’s Youtube playlist “Think Like A Programmer” will help you learn how to approach such problems.
