title: The Importance of Free Writing
---
In this blog post i will tell you why I enjoy free writing, and why I think you should do free writing as well. 

# What is free writing? 
Free writing is essentially writing freely - it is about getting something out of your brain on to paper, the idea is that you just write, you do not fix typos, you do not improve word choice, you do not second guess yourself. You just write. Now, personally some writers who engage in free writing (myself included), will make some tweaks as they are writing, but in my opinion - it is up to you as to how lenient you want to be, and it is about what works best for YOU. , 

# Ok, but why? 
At at first I always thought free writing was a waste of time, until I realized that I have time I am wasting elsewhere, which I can instead partly replace with the chance to write freely. For example, I find myself watching Youtube Videos of someone I can relate to, or talking and discussing something with someone, so instead I can focus some of this time on the free writing - particularly useful if the person doesn’t really want to talk to me at that time, because I can get similar results and not bug them [but thank you for thinking “surely everyone wants to talk you”]. 

## Letting your emotions and thoughts run 
I believe it is a bad idea to bottle up your emotions, I am all for the idea of just speaking your mind, free writing gives you a way to do this, Free writing lets you fantasize and for example, imaging you were writing a story about “what if I took that other job instead of my current job”, then you may be able to visualize a “best case”, and a worst case scenario as to what may have happened [do not forget that it is simply speculation] had you made this decision, and it may even influence your future decisions. Free writing in my opinion is yet another form of escapism, and it is relaxing. 

## It helps you brainstorm 
\Free writing gets your creative juices flowing, this blog post was partly inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bs7B68WHYZs&t=814s - “The Story of a Failed Game Dev” [Kurt Indovina] In which the Youtuber explains that he used free writing as a form of coming up with the storyline for his video game, before cherry picking his favorite ideas and taking it from there. Free writing allows your creative juices to flow, so it is particularly helpful if you are a creative looking to gain some ideas for your next project.  

## Increase /Practise your typing speed 
Lets face it, being able to type accurately at a reasonable pace is a productivity boost in our line of work, I have wasted so much time simply because I hit the wrong key, isn’t typing a great way to practise typing? I believe it is. But having said this, if you prefer physically writing then yeah, feel free to use handwriting, I like to type because my handwriting is terrible. 

## Improves your written communication skills 
Written communication skills are incredibly important for a software developer, whether it be writing documentation, persuading your team to use tool X over tool Y, or whatever, free writing will give you away to boost these skills. Another reason I started writing was the thought “what if I am in an exam and not able to write/type the answer quick enough”, well, if I can write/type fast enough and not lose the flow of my thoughts, then hopefully I can produce an answer relatively quickly after having studied the material. I believe writing also boosts your ability to recall. 

# Tips on free writing 
Personally, I do not consider my writing ability as good as I’d like. “No shit sherlock”, is what many of past teachers would likely say to themselves had they read this, but that's the beauty of free writing, the only limit is you, you do not need to write the best grammatically story in the world, write the story, then improve it’s grammar - no pressure. I mentioned that the idea is that you do not edit while you are free writing, well technically I mentioned that this is optional, but if you decide to take the edit route, I found that Grammarly helped me, but if you decide to take the non-edit route, and are comfortable with markdown, then you can use VSCode’s markdown previewer, not to mention it will let you use Git for your work. 

# And if you write something good 
If you write something, and then think “oh my, I am so proud I wrote that, I think other people will benefit from reading this”, then you can indeed sell your writing if you wish and benefit financially from it, I personally do not consider a financial gain as motivation to engage in free writing, but at the end of the day, you wrote it, do what you like with it.
