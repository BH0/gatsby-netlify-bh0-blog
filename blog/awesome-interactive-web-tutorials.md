This blog post is to make you aware of the awesome interactive tutorials out there for learning specific tooling, these types of web-apps make learning a new tool fun and (somewhat more) convenient. there are probably a lot more out there that I am used to, so don't consider this an exhaustive list, but these ones, in particular, have impressed me. 

Please note, that (most) of these are for learning a specific tool - and so "users" should only be concerned with learning that tool when using these. And be aware that yes, they may contain bugs. 

The main great thing about these is they provide you with a ready-to-go environment. Usually, as a developer, you can spend a lot of time installing stuff. realizing that things didn't install correctly and thus - re-installing the same thing... So much of my time has been wasted by installation Wizards, to the point where I think... I could have finished learning this tool by now, but my computer refuses to play nice with it. 

# Codecademy 
https://www.codecademy.com 
I am sort of cheating by putting this here, but it was my first dose of being able to learn something truly interactively - Codecademy is a website that allows you to learn various coding languages and tooling through their interactive website. This is what I used to start coding but I have not used it in a while. 

# Play-With-Docker Classroom 
https://training.play-with-docker.com 
https://training.play-with-kubernetes.com https://training.play-with-kubernetes.com
This one is for learning the containerization tool Docker. There is also one for Kubernates, but I am yet to explore Kubernates. 

# Flexbox Froggy 
https://flexboxfroggy.com 
This is a (fun, perhaps a bit childish) game for learning the CSS layout and display model: Flex/Flexbox. 

# Flexbox Defense 
http://www.flexboxdefense.com 
Pretty much the same concept as Flexbox Froggy. But from a tower-defense perspective... in case aligning frogs isn't your thing. 

# Grid Garden 
http://cssgridgarden.com 
Similar concept as Flexbox Froggy but for CSS Grid. 

# Trygit 
<no-longer available but included for historical reasons in the hope that it returns>
This one is for learning the version control system Git. In an easy and digestible manner.

These are all fun, engaging and convenient ways to practice tooling that people may otherwise procrastinate on learning.
