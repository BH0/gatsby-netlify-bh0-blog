title: Aspirations Change
---
This is just a short blog post (because I am too lazy, I mean, not motivated enough to describe how to make a Discord bot) about aspirations, more specifically, I am focusing on the fact that they change. 

Why aspirations change, I have no idea, but it happens to me frequently, which is somewhat I rarely have long term goals (see Jarvis's Youtube video - )https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3sXskf1gcg ). I want us to recognise that our dreams/desires/goals/aspirations/what-evers change overtime, with and without reason, and that it is completely natural when it happens - whether its a bad thing is up to you (but please try be optimistic). 

This can occur with long term goals and short term goals, for example, last night I was super motivated to wake up and code a Discord bot, but after thinking about it more and more, and the steps involved - I reached the conclusion that maybe I'll make the bot another day. 

One reason they might change is that they were thought of when you had a lack of information, though that's not always the case. Another reason might be that our emotional state is influencing our goals. 

Long story short, it happens, sometimes its for the best, other times its frustrating, which is why you should learn to muscle through and complete a task even if it feels like an unsatisfying grind so long as you have done your research to determine the grind is worth the pain. And if the grind is not worth the pain, then hopefully you can choose either not to do it or just do it and perhaps you'll be proven wrong in that it was worth the painful grind... Thanks for reading.
