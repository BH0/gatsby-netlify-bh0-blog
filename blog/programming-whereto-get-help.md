title: Programming Where To Get Help
---
I have already written about asking for help - which may be worth reading. And if you are open to asking for help but not sure how, checkout this Youtube video by LiveOverflow: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53zkBvL4ZB4 - which will at least discuss how not to ask for help (which is really just about being respectful of other people), 



There are tons of places you can go to for asking for help - both digitally, and non digitally, so instead of being a definitive list, this post will hopefully give you inspiration. 



Knowing how to ask for help, and what  to search for, such as the technology specific keywords can be difficult and as such - is a topic for another day. 



\# Google 

Pretty obvious, I know, but lately I've found myself literally copying + pasting errors I get into Google to get more clarity - especially helpful when at a glance errors look similar but are in fact different,  if I have multiple results that may be of use I open them up in multiple tabs and eliminate them one by one. Googling really is a skill a programmer should be good at. 



\# Official Documentation 

I think some documentation websites can be terrible, they are more reference guides for apparent mid / senior level developers than they are help to newcomers, but having said this - do not be afraid to skim through the official documentation and if that fails, then you can search elsewhere. 



\# My Websites of Preference 

I use all sorts of websites for help, this can be anything from a 2008 online community forum that is now pretty much dead, or one that was initiated by a product owner such as the Qt forum or Unity forum. I also use blogs, Youtube tutorials etcetera. 



But the main ones I find myself spending my time are Github - more specifically the "Issues" section, and StackOverflow   Github Issues is generally when you are facing something wrong with the tool you are using, and might need a quick workaround until there is a software update with a fix, whereas StackOverflow can have suggestions on how to use a tool to do something. And StackExchange or Quora may help with how you would approach something such as building a web browser. 



\# In Person 

This post assumes you are a self taught developer, and thus are mostly relying on on-line resources, but sometimes stuff just cannot be found online. 



\## Bootcamp / College / University 

If you are doing a college course or attending a programming bootcamp - these institutions likely have a means for you  to retrieve help, whether it be a lecturer or a student. 



\## Meetups 

Meetups, checkout a local meetup such as Codebar, or one of the many others on Meetup.com and similar websites. You might just have to ask for someone to give you their initial thoughts on solving a problem - or they may be super nice and sit down with you to walk through the problem. 



\## Your (In Person) network 

Software development is a career that is incredibly beneficial to know people in person - even if you do not need them immediately it doesn't hurt to determine who you can physically interact with who may know how to solve your  problem - or at least has a better way of approaching it than you. Ask around and determine friends of friends who are technology enthusiasts. If you are open to having coffee with developers on LinkedIn then this might also be a means of increasing your network. 

# Don't Be Afraid of Paper 
You know what they used before the internet:the library. I often visit my college library and [skim] read the books to kill time, and there have been various occaisions where it has paid off, especially for old topics. 

\# Online Communities 

Look for communities on Slack, and Gitter - my favorite is Discord, more specifically an amazing web development resource has been Reactiflux (and Nodeiflux). 



\# Paid Resources

If you are willing to pay then Udemy, Team Treehouse and similar platforms often times have a dedicated help section, and there are platforms like Codementor, where you can get one to one mentoring. I personally have never used something like this. 



\# Miscellaneous 

Often times it is about knowing where to look, so do not forget the "obvious" stuff like Youtube and blog comment sections. Most importantly, do not "disregard" someone's attempt to help - just because someone doesn't seem as knowledgeable as you - doesn't mean they haven't been solved the same issue as you before. 



And lastly, go for a walk, or a shower, when you step away from the computer - your subconscious mind will continue to work on your problem, exercising and the likes will help you get your brain .recharge and wake up again. Do not be afraid of creativity.
