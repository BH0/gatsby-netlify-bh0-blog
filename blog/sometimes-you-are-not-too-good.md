title: Sometimes You Are Not Too Good
---
We often decide not to do things because we believe we are "too good". This blog post is to tell you that even though you may be good enough, chances are you should still do it. 

One example may be to opt to write a program alone instead of allowing a junior to help you, but think of what that junior could learn if they even tried to help you. 

There is no guarantee that you should or should not do something, unless you can see the future. If you can do it, and think... something good will come out of it, do it. 

The inspiration for this blog post is essentially that I have been putting things of, thinking I have plenty of time to do them.. Then I get stuck in that vicious of cycle of, saying I will do something but not doing it until very last moment. Even though you may not have enjoyed reading, thanks for reading.
