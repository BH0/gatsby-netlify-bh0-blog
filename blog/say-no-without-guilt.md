title: Say No Without Guilt
---
This blog post is to encourage you to say no and not feel guilty, or sad afterwards. When I was younger, before I had responsibility and ambitions like I do now, I used to enjoy simply saying yes, but now, I am always conscious of “impulsively” or prematurely saying yes .

In this busy society, saying no is often discouraged, we are expected to do favors etcetera, but this is just a poor mentality to have. When you say no to someone, chances are you are guilt tripped into eventually saying yes, perhaps even bribed - or worse: blackmailed. 

It is is easier said than done, but it is important to say no, and you should not feel guilty because: if you say yes to everyone, you are going to run out of time and energy to do things for yourself. And if you do say yes despite not wanting to do what you were asked to do, chances are you are just going to do the bare minimum (or even the wrong thing)  to the point where it defeats the purpose of that person having asked for a favor. 

We have to say no to ourselves frequently, productivity is about having the most time to do things you want to, if you are simply reacting to events, then you are just deluding yourself into feeling productive, when in reality you are not being productive. We need to find the balance and be capable of prioritizing certain activities related to our own ambitions (which I am afraid is a topic for another day). This is partly why I believe mediation is important (or even just “me” time). 

When you are asked, or when you ask someone else, to do something, you [should] always have the luxury of saying no, the person (or yourself) should be asking knowing that there is a chance you will say no, and they should be prepared for you to say no. This is why it is good to have a variety of connections, where if one fails, then you can go to the other and perhaps they will be more willing to help. A friend of mine frequently says no to me and if anything, it gives me confidence in the friend because I have discovered that when he does say yes, me asking the person to do whatever I asked of them was incredibly beneficial - because they were actually willing to help out. 

I should mention that you should not say no to everything, there has been plenty of times where I originally wanted to say no, but ended up saying yes and being glad I said yes. And if it is a case of having to say no to a boss (or even a teacher), make sure you have a good reason for saying no, and are able to communicate to that person why it is important that you say no, and perhaps if there is something better you can do [for them] instead. This point slightly relates to being asked to attempt to fulfill unrealistic expectations. 

Sometimes you are not able to communicate why you said no, if this is the case, then perhaps you can keep note of the situation for future reference, meaning that if saying no turns out to be a bad decision, then you can use it as data to contribute to a future scenario that perhaps you said yes to but are not sure.
