title: Apps Without UIs
---
One thing I have a love/hate relationship with in software development is building user interfaces, yes libraries like React and Bulma help a lot, but sometimes I just don’t want to build a UI - whether it be because I don’t have the time, or I don’t know what it should look like or whatever. 

Especially as a backend developer, it can be challenging to get people using your apps when they look ugly. Hopefully this blog post will help you develop usable software without needing to be a CSS master. 

The answer is simple: do not give you an app a user interface, or, use someone else’s user interface - and no I am not talking about using a template (though that is an option, checkout a website such as HTML5up), and Wirify may even be of interest to you. 

While its true that some technical users don’t mind using the command line, I am talking about options that aren’t so intimidating to the end user. These options are with JavaScript in mind though you can use other languages if you wish. 

# Chat Bots 
I am talking about the world of voice assistants and bots. You can use libraries like Twit.js and DIscord.js to interactive cha bots for social media websites such as Discord and Twitter, meaning you can just use their user interface, and have your app run in the background. I love chat bots, they are so convenient. 

# Voice Assistants 
You can make an app for IOT devices such as Amazon’s Alexa and Google Assistant. 

# The Sad Part 
The sad part is, even if you make a voice assistant app, a chatbot or even something with the Raspberry Pi or Arduino, if you want to make an app that non technical users (and even technical users) are going to use, you still have to ask (and answer) questions regarding user friendliness.
