title: Just Chill

I want to take the time to tell you to just chill, thanks to an amazing friend doing the same for me and it has helped me so much, whenever you're feeling overwhelmed, take a deep breath and chill. 

When you are doing the thing you love, under pressure, try to chill. I am often less good at the thing I love under pressure, so lately I've been making the habit to just chill whilst doing what I love, we all make mistakes, if someone witnesses me make a mistake, then all I ask is that they forgive and hopefully I won't make the same mistake again. 

The brain performs so much better when relaxed, sure, adrenaline helps, but don't panic, live in the moment, focus and chill. Thanks for reading.
