title: Cant or Doesnt
---
I am not sure as to what this blog post should be called, but essentially the goal is to remind you that just because someone does or did not do something, it does not mean that they cannot do that particular thing. 

There have been several occasions where me not doing something I very much could do has impacted my future in a negative way simply because I did not do that particular thing. 

People have their reasons for not doing things, which is why if you want to know if I can do something, you should simply ask, and I’ll answer honestly - I might not admit why I would rather not do something, but at least I’ll tell you if I believe I can or cannot do something. A lack of evidence does not mean impossible - if that makes sense… 

When you are “evaluating” someone’s skill level, try not to underestimate their skill level based on what they have not done, and hopefully people do not underestimate your skill level based on what you have not done.
