title: What Scared Me Away From Python
---
Python is often recommended as a first language ,and both schools and universities/colleges are integrating the language into its curriculum. The language is a great language, and I cannot remember if Python was my first language or JavaScript. 

But despite Python being one of the most popular languages as well as one of the most powerful, I didn’t get very far with it. For several reasons. And as I was attempted to make a game in Pygame (a library for Python) I realized that the parts of Python that scared me away were pretty simple had I just taken the time, kept pushing and kept calm. 

# Object Oriented Programming 
Now, OOP is not specific to Python, but Python does support it, and many developers suggest using OOP concepts. I never understood what class meant, thus whenever I came across it I felt intimidated. I never realized that “__init__” was the syntax for making a constructor, I also never understood the meaning of underscores in the names’ of variables. Nor did I enjoy having to pass self (perhaps JavaScript was my first language as I am use to referring to “self” as “this”) as the first parameter of the constructor. 

# GUIs Were Awkward 
Because of the use of OOP in making graphical user interfaces, and my lack of understanding of creating graphical user interfaces, creating graphical user interfaces felt weird, complicated, counter-intuitive, counter-productive so I found myself writing console applications for too long - which led to frustration and possibly me “giving up”. Now that I am a [somewhat] competent web developer, I have come to realize that making GUIs with non web based / web inspired technology is awkward - and that usually when Python is used in programming, it is either for machine learning or the “backend” of a web-page (meaning the GUI is written using different technology, even if it is through the use of a templating engine). 

# Why This Matters 
The fact that I was too scared to continue learning a language that would had rewarded me greatly over four years ago is not the only reason for this blog post. The reason I wrote this blog post is that I let naivety, and a lack of results get the better of me whilst learning to program, and I do not want you to make the same mistake I did.
