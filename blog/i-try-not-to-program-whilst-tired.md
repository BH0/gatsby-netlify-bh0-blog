title: I Try Not To Program Whilst Tired
---
I would love to say that I am the type of programmer who can program under any circumstances, but that is not the case. I had an idea for a different blog post, but that blog post was to be a tutorial, and unfortunately, I do not have enough energy to write the tutorial (as I failed to write it beforehand because I am still breaking my "last moment" habit and really should start batching blog posts for times like this). 

This blog post is about why I opt not to program when sleepy, and the answer is simple, I am less productive. Now granted, sometimes after the initial fifteen minutes I am back to my old self, and able to program like usual, but due to the recent walk I just did, my brain is not capable of waking up. So, at the risk of producing poor content that may not make sense, I am going to go to sleep and program when I have the energy to do so.  

With productivity, you can do two options, A. complete a task when you aren't at your best and take your time doing the task, perhaps even messing up, or B. postponing the task until you have the ability to complete the task well - though I can understand opting not to do this as it may result in procrastination. 

There are sometimes when I program before sleeping, and I find it helps me think when my brain is relaxed, and I am able to just take my time and think both calmly and logically. But again, I am too tired right now. 

Conclusion: if you do not feel you are able to "get in the zone" [you know, that place where its like you forget about the rest of the world and focus on the task at hand], then do not feel pressured into programming [assuming you are not facing a deadline].
