I suspect that many programmers choose web development because it is potentially the quicket at delivering results, as you can code user interfaces incredibly quickly and with relative ease compared to other technologies. 



However, while being a results oriented person in my opinion is a good thing, it may lead to a bad habit. 



This bad habit is what some may refer to as botching, doing quick and dirty implenentations that get what you want in the short term, but may come back to haunt you. 



This is a habit that programmers should not develop, programmers prefer clean code bases, even if it means more work. 





Not to mention the issues with instant gratification outside of software development. Thanks for reading.
