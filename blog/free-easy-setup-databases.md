title: Free Easy Setup Databases
---
In this blog post I am going to inform you of the many free "no installation" databases that exist. These are helpful for quick prototypes as they allow you to get something up and running without too much of a hassle. I particular love them because I am always running into issues where my computer seems to dislike a particular program - for example, I currently cannot use MySQL on my local machine because of a strange bug I am yet to investigate. 



Now, obviously there are a ton of free databases but these are ones that are already set up for you, as in no installation needed. I would love to do demonstrations but that may be retained for separate posts. 



\# MLabs - https://mlab.com 

MLabs is a \[NoSQL] MongoDB solution, which has a free tier, and is incredibly easy to use - I love it for my Node prototypes.... 



\# DB4Free - https://www.db4free.net

DB4Free is a \[relational] MySQL database that is designed for prototypes. All you do is fill in a simple form and you can easily connect.... 



\# Firebase - https://firebase.google.com 

Firebase is a service offered by Google, it contains two databases as well as a bunch of other solutions, the two databases are NoSQL (non-relational) databases, these are "Firebase real time database" and "Firebase Cloud Firestore", I plan on using these a lot as they offer shiny advanced features out of the box. 

# More 
There are potentially more. I love that these solutions exist because sometimes it can be a hassle having to install the database system locally on your machine, which can be error prone. Plus, with these solutions - while not fit for a production app, there is nothing to say you cannot use them for a "non commercial" app like a portfolio project or even just something for the community.
