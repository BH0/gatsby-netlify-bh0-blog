title: Overcoming A Productivity Slump
---
Let us face it, motivation is not constant, it comes and goes, things happen that decrease and increase our motivation, things that will increase our motivation don’t happen, so motivation cannot be relied upon to be productive, but its difficult to work when not motivated, so hopefully this blog post will help you muscle on until your motivation is back. 

# Complete simple tasks 
Complete the simple tasks first, just do them, try to do them on autopilot, even if you have to bribe yourself with a cookie or something, get them over and done with. Even if its not aligned with your ultimate goal, just do it and see how you feel. The little things makeup for a lot. 

# Break tasks down 
If you are wanting to program an app, first you are going to want to open up your text editor, so do that, then you are going to have to know what to program, so make a list of potential features you might need to code. 

# Change your scenery
Go for a walk, a change of scenery and exercise will help your brain wake up, thus making it easier to start tasks. 

# Work for at least small amount time 
I covered this in my “Program for 15 minutes” blog post, the idea is that you only have to work for a certain amount of time, once the timer ends, what you do afterwards is entirely up to you. 

# Complete high impact tasks
MPJ discusses this in his videos, the idea is that instead of doing tiring work, you ask yourself, what task would make me feel better, and prioritize that one task, checkout https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAt5E2xrXH8&t=230s and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2KbMeS9lLQ&t=231s - as well as his other videos. 

# Don’t worry if you could do better
Do not let the idea of not doing good enough stop you from starting, sure, you might be able to do better, but you have to realize that in the meantime, so long as you do it, you can improve it at a later date when your more motivated. 

# Ask yourself why
Most, if not all, of these suggestions overlap, for example, when you choose the tasks you prioritize, ask yourself if you really  need to do it, and ask yourself why. Also look into where your motivation comes from, why did you want to build that cool web app in the first place? Why did you start learning this particular skill, keep a note of the answer for future reference, and has your answer changed? 

# This topic is an endless discussion 
There are tons of productivity tips, and I am sure I have mentioned these in previous blog posts, humans are not robots, not all of us can work on autopilot consistently, our circumstances change, we cannot predict the future, but we can tolerate the present, and we can strive to improve the present, so that the future becomes better. This stuff may or may not work for you, but I hope you do find what works for you, thanks for reading.
