title: Improve Your Life Via Your Diet
---
This blog post is to encourage you to think about the impact your diet has on your life. I am not a nutritionist so this is highly speculative. 

We all know that eating healthy is likely to improve how long you live for. But there are more side effects to eating other than the impact to your weight and physical health. 

Such as your mood, certain foods are suspected to have a different impact on your mood. And I am currently investigating how to improve my vision naturally. 

Try not to fall victim to cravings. Cravings will likely only benefit you in the short term, and as they come and go, may lead to you growing sick of a certain food. Cravings are an emotional response so if you have them, ask yourself why. 

I believe that your diet (even if it's only loosely) should be customised to suit your needs. A diet is not a fashion statement so don't bother with what the herd are doing. And you do not need to drastically change your diet, instead incrementally introduce new foods and find out what works for you. 

Diet is where consistency is key, you are incredibly unlikely to see the immediate effects of your diet. So it may help to consult with a professional nutritionist before making such adjustments and be upfront with them about your desired outcome/s.
