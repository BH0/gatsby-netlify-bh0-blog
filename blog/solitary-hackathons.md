title: Solitary Hackathons

A hackathon is an event where people attempt to complete a project within a certain amount of time, such as 24 or 48 hours. There is usually a theme (especially in game jams - a type of hackathon) which helps inspire people on what to make. 

Hackathons are a great way to test out ideas, or just get something working in a short amount of time. You are usually able to do a lot of in a hackathon because you (and your group) are solely focused on creating the project. 

I love doing hackathons, so much that I even do them alone, and I encourage you to do so as well. They are a great way for me to learn a new technology, as well as a way express myself. Sometimes I will make something useful - that I will continue to work on, sometimes I won't. I have a Google Doc full of ideas of what to make, and not enough time. They take advantage of a technique called "time boxing", and are a great way to practice both your project management skills and your programming skills. 

Companies even encourage both hackathons, whether it be sponsoring a hackathon, or an internal hackathon typically referred to as a "hackday". Or they allow time for their employees to work on and learn what they want, regardless of whether it helps the company or not. 

The hackathons projects are not to be flawless, given that there is such a short volume of time, its understandable that there will be bugs. So don't feel [too] bad when your project isn't as perfect as you imagined it to be. The best part is, you can make up the rules [but try and stick to those rules]. 

There is one risk of doing hackathons too frequently, and that is burnout. If you are going to use a hackathon project for your portfolio, make sure you polish them before hand. Though I did mention a hackathon project in an interview, which I think was a good idea. Thanks for reading, happy hacking.
