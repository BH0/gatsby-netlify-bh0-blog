title: Read Notes
---
This is just a quick blog post to remind myself, and you to read notes that you have taken. 

I highly encourage you to take notes, I have a terrible memory (and even if I don't I don't like depending on my memory) so to keep me up to date, I make a habit out of taking and reading my notes. 

Sometimes I rewrite the same or similar notes (preferably from memory) To jog my brain. 

If you're ever thinking "hmm now what?" that's when you should glance at your notes. 

I'd love to tell you how to organise your notes but that's a different blog post and mostly personal preference. 

Too long didn't read: read your notes, even if you know what they are, don't be afraid to double check.
