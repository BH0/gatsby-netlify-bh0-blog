title: How to make 8Bit Music (Or At Least How I Did)
---
I am sure you know what 8-bit music, also known as chiptune is, but just to be sure, 8 bit (or any bit under 32 bits) music is music that many old (and new) video games make use of, such as games like Pacman. 

The tones often seem very high pitch, the melodies are catchy. And, if you played video games in the 90s or so, very nostalgic. Many new, particular indie games (independently made) games are making use of this music too. And, thus the music genre has made somewhat of a comeback - and you probably want to replicate it too. 

To be honest, I don't know if it is justifiable to attempt to teach music using only text... So, I will just tell you the tools I used to do so, please note, that I am (not yet) a professional at making this type of music. 

The reason this type of music was made was due to the limited space that the early comuters had. But, pixels and bits are cool, so it's not like these early video game developers/designers were limited in creativity. 

# FL Studio

I love this digital audio workstation, and recently, I just discovered that it can be used to make chiptune e/8-bit music. The program requires you to pay if you wish to re-open your saved work, but that doesn't mean you cannot make your audio track without closing the program, then exporting your work as an audio file and saving that somewhere. Here is an awesome Youtube video by Busy Works Beats to help get you started: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86c4TMGCzQ8&list=PLGxiyRm2uEmr3dtD7BZyvvtiI2RyrGiwe&index=11  - 8Bit Music FULL TUTORIAL WALKTHROUGH | FL Studio 20 Note that when he does "make unique", unless you have purchased FL Studio, you will have to manually clone and then add your pattern. 

There is also an FL Slaer preset called FX Atari 2600 Computer, and FL Space Invaders. 

# FamTracker

This is a lightweight tool \[once you do enough clicking around it becomes simple] that I used to attempt to use alongside BFXR (website for sound effects) to make the music for my games. 

# Program Your Own

JavaScript libraries such as ToneJS and Scriblletune may allow you to make your music using code!
