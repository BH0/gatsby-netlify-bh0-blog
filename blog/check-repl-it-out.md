title: Check Repl.it Out
---
This blog post is simply to inform you of an awesome web application called Repl.it. I plan on using this web app to make more tutorials, and I use it for my own projects too. 

Repl.it is an online IDE, similar to Codesandbox and Cloud9 IDE etcetera, however, Repl.it separates itself from the others as it is a platform designed for education, they have features which are tailored for educators. 

The platform is continuously being developed and repeatedly getting new features. My favorite features so far have been the built in version history feature, but you can also link your Repl.it projects to your Github. I love the templates and prebuild environments such as Pygame - very convenient for getting something up and running with little to no hassle. And the ability to install pacakges easily. I appreciate the built in file manager. And I love how easy it is to share my projects and my applications. 

Repl.it offers a range of languages and environments and are repeatedly adding new languages, as well as features, while the web app works best for web development, you are not limited to web only applications, as proven with their Python interpreter. For example, they are working on a "multiplayer" feature which I believe will allow users to work on the same application at the same time from different computers. 

They also host competitions such as hackathons to encourage the community to try out their new features. 

Repl really takes advantage of the "read, evaluate, print, loop" mentality and takes this to a whole new level. Thanks for reading and I suggest you checkout Repl.it as soon as you can.
